# cscl-subaddress-adhoc

The New York City Citywide Street Centerline (CSCL) database "subaddress" table contains unit addresses (aka subaddresses) associated with an address point. New York City emergency response agencies and related systems use subaddresses.

In addition to the annual bulk update using 3rd party commercial data described in [CSCL-Subaddress-Matched](https://github.com/mattyschell/cscl-subaddress-matched) we also receive ad hoc requests to tidy up subaddress data.  

This repository is intended to be a spot to dump history on those ad hoc requests.  Friends, this is our dumping ground for ad hoc requests, our rules, the trick is never to be afraid.
